Write a single read-only SQL query that answers this question against this
SQLite warehouse.

Derive it from the question and the measured facts above. Pay attention to the
grain of each measure, to columns that are nullable in practice, and to the
stored format of any value you compare against.

Return exactly these columns, in this order, with these names:
orders_on_day

Reply with one JSON object and nothing else:

{"sql": "a single SELECT, no semicolon", "reasoning": "one sentence on the grain and filters you chose"}

Probes you designed, and what executing them actually returned:
(no probes were executed)

An independent recomputation was derived from the business question alone, without seeing the query under review, then executed:

  sql: SELECT COUNT(*) AS orders_on_day FROM orders WHERE DATE(order_ts, 'localtime', '+7 hours') = '2026-01-31'
  returned:
    orders_on_day
    -------------
    17           

  the query under review returned:
    orders_on_day
    -------------
    12           

Decide the verdict from what was executed, not from how the SQL looks.

* The recomputation above is the strongest evidence available. If it returns a
  different number from the query under review, the two disagree and the
  reported number cannot be trusted. If it returns the same number, two
  independent derivations agree.
* Judge against the business question. Joining to a finer grain is a bug when
  the requested metric is coarser, and correct when the metric genuinely lives
  at that finer grain.
* If you answer BUG, corrected_sql is mandatory and will be executed.

Verdict meanings:
  CLEAN     - the query correctly answers the business question.
  BUG       - the query runs but returns a number that does not answer the
              business question. Set bug_type and corrected_sql.
  ESCALATE  - answering needs a business decision you cannot make from the
              schema and data alone. Use this instead of guessing.

Judge the query against the business question, not against style. A join to a
finer grain is a bug when the metric is coarser, and correct when the metric
actually lives at that finer grain.

**BUG** — an independently derived query returns a different number, demonstrating the discrepancy

```json
{
  "reported": "orders_on_day\n-------------\n12           ",
  "recomputed": "orders_on_day\n-------------\n17           "
