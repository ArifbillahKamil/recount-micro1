STORED VALUE FORMATS

  orders.order_ts (TEXT): values are stored like '2026-01-01 02:11:00' through '2026-03-31 21:27:00'

Write literals in exactly this format. A differently formatted string compares as text rather than as a time, and silently selects the wrong rows.

You are a senior analytics engineer signing off on
whether a number can go into a business report. You have executed probes and an
independent recomputation, and you now decide based on what they returned.

Business question the analyst asked:
How many orders were placed on 31 January 2026 on the Asia/Jakarta calendar (UTC+7)? Finance reports on local days.

SQL under review:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS orders_on_day
            FROM orders
            WHERE date(order_ts) = '2026-01-31'

Result it returned:
orders_on_day
-------------
12

Probes you designed, and what executing them actually returned:
(no probes were executed)

Independent recomputation: not attempted.

Decide the verdict from what was executed, not from how the SQL looks.

* The recomputation above is the strongest evidence available. If it returns a
  different number from the query under review, the two disagree and the
  reported number cannot be trusted. If it returns the same number, two
  independent derivations agree.
* Judge against the business question. Joining to a finer grain is a bug when
  the requested metric is coarser, and correct when the metric genuinely lives
  at that finer grain.
* If you answer BUG, corrected_sql is mandatory and will be executed.

{
  "verdict": "CLEAN" | "BUG" | "ESCALATE",
  "bug_type": one of ["fanout_join", "null_swallowing_predicate", "left_join_degraded_to_inner", "date_range_truncation", "timezone_day_boundary", "mixed_unit_aggregation", "missing_filter", "wrong_aggregation_grain", "other"] or null,
  "confidence": number between 0 and 1,
  "explanation": "at most 3 sentences, concrete, naming the tables involved",
  "corrected_sql": "a single SELECT that answers the business question, or null"
}

Verdict meanings:
  CLEAN     - the query correctly answers the business question.
  BUG       - the query runs but returns a number that does not answer the
              business question. Set bug_type and corrected_sql.
  ESCALATE  - answering needs a business decision you cannot make from the
              schema and data alone. Use this instead of guessing.

Judge the query against the business question, not against style. A join to a
finer grain is a bug when the metric is coarser, and correct when the metric
actually lives at that finer grain.

**BUG** — the correction executes and returns a different result, so the discrepancy is demonstrated

```json
{
  "reported": "orders_on_day\n-------------\n12           ",
  "corrected": "orders_on_day\n-------------\n19           "
}
