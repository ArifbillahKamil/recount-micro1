Business question:
What revenue did we capture from completed orders only, in cents?

Write a single read-only SQL query that answers this question against this
SQLite warehouse.

Derive it from the question and the measured facts above. Pay attention to the
grain of each measure, to columns that are nullable in practice, and to the
stored format of any value you compare against.

The result must not depend on where or when the query runs. Do not use
'localtime', 'now', CURRENT_DATE or random(): use an explicit offset such as
date(col, '+7 hours') and literal dates.

Return exactly these columns, in this order, with these names:
revenue_cents

Reply with one JSON object and nothing else:

{"sql": "a single SELECT, no semicolon", "reasoning": "one sentence on the grain and filters you chose"}

Probes you designed, and what executing them actually returned:
(no probes were executed)

An independent recomputation was derived from the business question alone, without seeing the query under review, then executed:

  sql: SELECT SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price_cents) AS revenue_cents FROM orders o JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id WHERE o.status = 'completed'
  returned:
    revenue_cents
    -------------
    5468920000   

  the query under review returned:
    revenue_cents
    -------------
    7301960000   

Decide the verdict from what was executed, not from how the SQL looks.

* The recomputation above is the strongest evidence available. If it returns a
  different number from the query under review, the two disagree and the
  reported number cannot be trusted. If it returns the same number, two
  independent derivations agree.
* Judge against the business question. Joining to a finer grain is a bug when
  the requested metric is coarser, and correct when the metric genuinely lives
  at that finer grain.
* If you answer BUG, corrected_sql is mandatory and will be executed.

Verdict meanings:
  CLEAN     - the query correctly answers the business question.
  BUG       - the query runs but returns a number that does not answer the
              business question. Set bug_type and corrected_sql.
  ESCALATE  - answering needs a business decision you cannot make from the
              schema and data alone. Use this instead of guessing.

Judge the query against the business question, not against style. A join to a
finer grain is a bug when the metric is coarser, and correct when the metric
actually lives at that finer grain.

**BUG** — an independently derived query returns a different number, demonstrating the discrepancy
