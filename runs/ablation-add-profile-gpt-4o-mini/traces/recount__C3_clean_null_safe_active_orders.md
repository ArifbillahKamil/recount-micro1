Business question:
How many orders are not cancelled? Orders with an unset status count as not cancelled.

MEASURED COLUMN FACTS

orders: 1500 rows, one row per order_id
  order_id: INTEGER, pk, 1500 distinct
  customer_id: INTEGER, 389 distinct
  order_ts: TEXT, 1493 distinct, values run '2026-01-01 02:11:00' .. '2026-03-31 21:27:00'
  status: TEXT, NULL in 80 rows (5.3%) -- a predicate on this column must handle NULL explicitly, 4 distinct
  currency: TEXT, 2 distinct

Match the stored format exactly when you write a literal. The quoted ranges above show how values are actually stored; comparing against a differently formatted string compares text, not time, and silently selects the wrong rows.

Write a single read-only SQL query that answers this question against this
SQLite warehouse.

Derive it from the question and the measured facts above. Pay attention to the
grain of each measure, to columns that are nullable in practice, and to the
stored format of any value you compare against.

The result must not depend on where or when the query runs. Do not use
'localtime', 'now', CURRENT_DATE or random(): use an explicit offset such as
date(col, '+7 hours') and literal dates.

Return exactly these columns, in this order, with these names:
active_orders

Business question the analyst asked:
How many orders are not cancelled? Orders with an unset status count as not cancelled.

SQL under review:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS active_orders
            FROM orders
            WHERE COALESCE(status, 'unknown') <> 'cancelled'

Result it returned:
active_orders
-------------
1357

Probes you designed, and what executing them actually returned:
(no probes were executed)

An independent recomputation was derived from the business question alone, without seeing the query under review, then executed:

  sql: SELECT COUNT(*) AS active_orders FROM orders WHERE status IS NULL OR status != 'cancelled'
  returned:
    active_orders
    -------------
    1357         

  the query under review returned:
    active_orders
    -------------
    1357         

Decide the verdict from what was executed, not from how the SQL looks.

* The recomputation above is the strongest evidence available. If it returns a
  different number from the query under review, the two disagree and the
  reported number cannot be trusted. If it returns the same number, two
  independent derivations agree.
* Judge against the business question. Joining to a finer grain is a bug when
  the requested metric is coarser, and correct when the metric genuinely lives
  at that finer grain.
* If you answer BUG, corrected_sql is mandatory and will be executed.

Verdict meanings:
  CLEAN     - the query correctly answers the business question.
  BUG       - the query runs but returns a number that does not answer the
              business question. Set bug_type and corrected_sql.
  ESCALATE  - answering needs a business decision you cannot make from the
              schema and data alone. Use this instead of guessing.

Judge the query against the business question, not against style. A join to a
finer grain is a bug when the metric is coarser, and correct when the metric
actually lives at that finer grain.
